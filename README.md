# functional-programming-project
Final team project for my OCaml course which was a functional version of the board game Settler's of Catan (supports two players). By browsing the source code folder you will see how we broke up the game into different components based on functionality to keep our code organized and manageable. Each code file is documented extensively to make clear to the reader exactly what each block or function accomplishes.

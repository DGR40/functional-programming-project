# functional-programming-project
Final project for my OCaml course that I completed with a four person team. This project we created a version of the board game "Settler's of Catan" using only Ocaml. By browsing the source code folder you will see how we broke up the game into different components based on functionality to keep our code organized and manageable. Each code file is documented extensively to make clear to the reader exactly what each block or function accomplishes.
